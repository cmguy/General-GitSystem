2014-10-16	v1.2		Build: CFX-EMM-GITSystem_1_2

			Description:
				Updated Admin and User guides for new user testing and usage. 

				Setup apache so git user can configure and CADA admin access can
				sudo command all needed apache commands. This removes the need to
				sudo to root for all anticipated apache maintenance. Admin guide
				updated accordingly.

				Added CHANGELOG component fields Installations and Access to track
				iTRC applications, devices, and CADA Host groups for EM&M git repos.

				Upgraded workstation Git for windows from June 11th release to 
				September 29th release.

				Corrected gitsys-failover-mirror.bsh script so repos are re-cloned
				when and update has been made on the corresponding repo on the
				primary system.

                        Installations:
                                iTRC Application(s) (Repeat for each iTRC app.)

			Access - CADA Host groups
				emmutl-po-7p.sys.comcsat.net
				cmputl-ch2-4p.sys.comcast.net

			Change Records/Bugs/Defects:
				None identified.

			Known Issues/Plans:
				A) Full Backups for recovery of objects that have been removed
				   also needed for weekly, for four weeks, and monthly for one
				   year.
				B) Testing and validation of branching and merging as
				   described in the user guide.
				C) Need to create/test build/deployment automation. Study and
				   come up to speed on RPM.
				D) Need to update and test for handling module and sub-modules.
				E) Need to incorporate usage of getopts for managing script
				   arguments.
				F) Utilities Under consideration - documentation via
				     git-scm.com/docs/git-[gc|repack|bundle])
				   git-gc(1)
				     Cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository.
				   git-repack(1)
				     Pack unpacked objects in a repository.
				   git-bundle(1)
				     Move objects and refs by archive - Considering this for
				     backups to be held for 3 days, 4 weekly's, and Monthly backups
				     to be held for 1 year.
